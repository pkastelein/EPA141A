# EPA1361 Model-based Decision-making Project â€“ Group 20

This project is part of the **EPA1361 Model-based Decision-making** course at **TU Delft**.
This README outlines the structure and main components of the Group 20 project.

Any files or folders not mentioned here are part of the original project setup or support framework. If not described, they are assumed to be unchanged.

## Project Description

This project investigates the effectiveness of various **flood risk management policies** under deep uncertainty. The goal is to assess and compare the impact of interventions such as:

* Dike heightenings
* Room for the River projects
* Early warning systems

Policies are evaluated in a range of uncertain future scenarios to assess their robustness and trade-offs. The analysis is divided into two main phases:

1. **Exploratory modeling** to identify which levers (policy options) and uncertainties have the most influence on outcomes like flood damage or system reliability.
2. **Directed search and robustness testing** to find policies that perform consistently well across many possible futures.

We use both open exploration and directed search methods to evaluate the performance and vulnerabilities of each strategy.

## Data Files

Below is an overview of key data and input folders:

* `LHS_results`: Results from Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) used for subspace partitioning
* `optimization_150000_seed20_results`: Results of optimization for 10 selected scenarios using seed 20 and 150,000 evaluations
* `optimization_150000_seed21_results`: Same as above, but for seed 21
* `policies_seed_20`: 9 selected policies from the Pareto front for seed 20
* `policies_seed_21`: 9 selected policies from the Pareto front for seed 21
* `policy_scenario_results_20`: Results of the 9 selected policies applied to 10 scenarios for seed 20
* `policy_scenario_results_21`: Same as above, but for seed 21
* `robustness_results`: Final 4 policies tested against 100,000 new scenarios
* `robustness_results_other_aggregation`: Same 4 policies tested against 50,000 scenarios using a different aggregation method
* `scenarios`: Filtered scenario space, categorized into favorable, unfavorable, and medium scenarios
* `selected_4_policies`: The 4 final selected policies (2 from each seed)
* `sobol_results`: Results from the Sobol sensitivity analysis
* `zero_policy_results`: Results of a baseline run (zero policy) across 100,000 scenarios

These files are generated by running `Main_data_generation_document.ipynb`.

* `plots`: Contains the output figures in .png format, generated by `Main_data_visualization_document.ipynb`

## Code Files

### Data Generation

* `Main_data_generation_document.ipynb`
  Contains all code required to generate the dataset. **Do not run this notebook all at once**, as it includes long-running simulations. Individual sections may take up to 60 hours on a standard machine.
  Inline comments and markdown cells describe the functionality. Refer to the report for further details.

### Visualization

* `Main_data_visualization_document.ipynb`
  Generates plots summarizing simulation outcomes and scenario analysis. Runtime is significantly shorter than the data generation script but may still be time-consuming.

---

## Report and Visuals

A detailed report is located in the `./report/` folder. It includes:

* Policy levers and uncertainties considered
* Model structure and experimental setup
* Key findings from exploratory modeling and robustness testing
* Visual summaries and scenario plots

---

## Running the Project

### 1. Install ema_workbench Dependencies

Ensure Python 3.11 or higher is installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -U ema_workbench[recommended] seaborn
```

Other imports are relatively standard imports. If there are any imports used that are not installed on your desktop, please refer to online documentation on how to install those.

### 2. (Optional) Regenerate the Data

To regenerate data, ensure all input files are present and run the appropriate sections of `Main_data_generation_document.ipynb`.

### 3. Generate Visualizations

With the required input data available, run `Main_data_visualization_document.ipynb` to produce updated plots.
